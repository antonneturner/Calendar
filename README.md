# Calendar

The name of this project is Dayplanner. It allows individuals to add plans to their day and to save those changes. It also displays past, present and future displays in an color coded array.
I created this planner to further implment my skills within Jquery,javascript, css and html.
I made this planner using Jquery, javascript, html and css properties.
My motivation behind making this planner was to further strengthen my developer skills.
I learned much more about Jquery javascript functions, parameters, arguements, if else statements arrays and intervals, and index arrays.
I also feel more confident in my usage of class selectors with jquery.
